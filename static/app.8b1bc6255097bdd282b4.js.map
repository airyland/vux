This system mirrors how the magnitude of numbers written as strings\n    // works.\n    // Consider a number written as: \"abc\". An example would be \"200\". Any other number written\n    // \"xyz\" will be smaller than \"abc\" so long as `a > z`. For instance, \"199\" is smaller\n    // then \"200\", even though \"y\" and \"z\" (which are both 9) are larger than \"0\" (the value\n    // of (`b` and `c`). This is because the leading symbol, \"2\", is larger than the other\n    // leading symbol, \"1\".\n    // The rule is that symbols to the left carry more weight than symbols to the right\n    // when a number is written out as a string. In the above strings, the leading digit\n    // represents how many 100's are in the number, and it carries more weight than the middle\n    // number which represents how many 10's are in the number.\n    // This system of number magnitude works well for route specificity, too. A route written as\n    // `a/b/c` will be more specific than `x/y/z` as long as `a` is more specific than\n    // `x`, irrespective of the other parts.\n    // Because of this similarity, we assign each type of segment a number value written as a\n    // string. We can find the specificity of compound routes by concatenating these strings\n    // together, from left to right. After we have looped through all of the segments,\n    // we convert the string to a number.\n    specificity.val = '';\n\n    for (var i = 0, l = segments.length; i < l; i++) {\n      var segment = segments[i],\n          match;\n\n      if (match = segment.match(/^:([^\\/]+)$/)) {\n        results.push(new DynamicSegment(match[1]));\n        names.push(match[1]);\n        specificity.val += '3';\n      } else if (match = segment.match(/^\\*([^\\/]+)$/)) {\n        results.push(new StarSegment(match[1]));\n        specificity.val += '2';\n        names.push(match[1]);\n      } else if (segment === \"\") {\n        results.push(new EpsilonSegment());\n        specificity.val += '1';\n      } else {\n        results.push(new StaticSegment(segment));\n        specificity.val += '4';\n      }\n    }\n\n    specificity.val = +specificity.val;\n\n    return results;\n  }\n\n  // A State has a character specification and (`charSpec`) and a list of possible\n  // subsequent states (`nextStates`).\n  //\n  // If a State is an accepting state, it will also have several additional\n  // properties:\n  //\n  // * `regex`: A regular expression that is used to extract parameters from paths\n  //   that reached this accepting state.\n  // * `handlers`: Information on how to convert the list of captures into calls\n  //   to registered handlers with the specified parameters\n  // * `types`: How many static, dynamic or star segments in this route.
